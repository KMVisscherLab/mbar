      This page provides the data dictionary utilized by the McKnight
      Brain Aging Registry (MBAR). A data dictionary is a
      comprehensive tool that catalogs and describes the various data
      elements collected in our studies. It includes definitions,
      formats, possible values, and the relationships between
      different data elements, ensuring that all data users have a
      common understanding of the terms used. The data dictionary is
      essential for researchers and collaborators to effectively
      access, interpret, and analyze the data, thereby maintaining the
      integrity and consistency of the research. Explore this resource
      to fully leverage the data available for your studies on brain
      aging and cognitive decline.
