      This page contains the information you need to understand what datasets are available as part of the McKnight Brain Aging Registry.
    Raw data: after basic quality control and checking, as obtained from participants. These raw data include:
o Pdfs of in-person behavioral measures
o Raw MRI datasets
o Blood; frozen blood samples. (These are limited in quantity)
o Trial-level scores on individual behavioral and neuropsychological tests
• Minimally processed biomarker data: results from processing on frozen blood samples. For example, raw results of ELIZA.
• Minimally preprocessed MRI data: this involves applying a set of standard preprocessing algorithms to the data, to prepare for a set of typical data analyses. For example, skull stripping, identification of white matter and pial boundaries, identification of timepoints of movement in functional MRI, etc. (see Glasser et al., 2016).
• Processed images: whole brain image files; one per participant, obtained after data processing. For example, individual participants’ whole brain functional connectivity to the posterior cingulate cortex.
• Tabular data: This involves data that has been processed to give a single value for each participant. These data include, for example:
o Participant demographics
o Behavioral data factor scores indicating weighting on each of 5 factors
(see Nolin et al., 2022)
o Categorization of participants based on exercise levels (sedentary vs
cardio and strength training, see Ho et al., 2024)
o FMRI data indicating strength of connection among brain regions
designated as the “Default Mode Network”
2
o Cortical thickness of each of >200 pre-defined brain regions
o Levels of BDNF measured in blood
o Data that are potentially identifiable (e.g., age over 89 years old) will be
distributed only to investigators who are on the IRB for this project.    </p>
