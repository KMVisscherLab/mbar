    </h1>
    <p class="mt-6 text-xl leading-8">
      The McKnight Brain Research Foundation, established in 1999 by
      Evelyn F. McKnight, is dedicated to enhancing our understanding
      and treatment of age-related cognitive decline and memory loss.
      It is the only private foundation solely focused on unraveling
      the mysteries of the aging brain and promoting cognitive health
      throughout an individual’s lifetime. With an investment
      exceeding $180 million, the foundation has been pivotal in
      funding groundbreaking research and fostering initiatives
      through its partnerships with the four McKnight Brain Institutes
      and the National Institute on Aging.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-xl leading-8">
      The foundation's strategic pillars emphasize leadership in
      establishing dedicated research on cognitive decline, inspiring
      public knowledge and maintaining cognitive health, and fostering
      strong partnerships with key scientific and academic bodies.
      These collaborations have led to significant advancements,
      including the establishment of endowed chairs in honor of Evelyn
      McKnight at various institutes, aimed at driving research in
      neurology and the neurobiology of learning and memory.

    <p class="mt-6 text-xl leading-8">
      The McKnight Brain Institutes, integral components of the
      foundation’s efforts, are hubs of multidisciplinary research
      aimed at understanding cognitive aging and developing
      interventions to maintain and enhance cognitive function. These
      institutes, located at the universities of Alabama, Arizona,
      Florida, and Miami, bring together leading researchers to
      explore and address the neurobiological bases of memory and
      aging, supported by cutting-edge facilities and collaborative
      networks that enrich the field of cognitive neuroscience.
