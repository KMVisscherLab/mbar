      Researchers are improving methods to predict brain age from
      Magnetic Resonance Images (MRIs) through machine learning. These
      models calculate the difference between predicted brain age and
      actual age (brain-PAD), serving as an indicator of either
      pathology or healthy aging. One challenge is that most models
      are developed using high-quality research MRIs, which differ
      significantly from routine clinical scans in terms of
      variability and resolution. To address this issue, initiatives
      are focusing on enhancing data collection from diverse MRI
      modalities, including routine clinical scans. Techniques like
      Synthetic Super-Resolution are employed to upgrade the
      resolution of these clinical images to match research-grade
      data. This refined data collection strategy helps in adapting
      the models to be effective across various MRI settings, making
      brain age prediction a versatile tool for both research and
      clinical diagnostics. Improved data collection supports the
      broader application of brain age as a diagnostic measure,
      facilitating personalized medicine and proactive disease
      management.
