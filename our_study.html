      Researchers are advancing methods to predict brain age from
      Magnetic Resonance Images (MRIs) using machine learning, aiming
      to establish it as a reliable biomarker of health conditions.
      The difference between an individual's brain age, as predicted
      by these models, and their actual age (brain-PAD) is gaining
      attention as an indicator of either pathology or healthy aging.
      Most existing models, however, are trained on high-quality
      research MRIs and struggle with the variability and lower
      resolution of routine clinical scans. To bridge this gap,
      initiatives like the transfer of learning from research to
      clinical-grade MRIs, utilizing techniques like Synthetic
      Super-Resolution, are being explored. These methods adapt models
      to perform accurately across various MRI modalities, potentially
      making brain age prediction a useful tool in both research and
      clinical settings. This approach could democratize the use of
      brain age as a diagnostic tool, making it applicable across
      diverse medical environments, thereby enhancing personalized
      medicine and aiding in disease prediction and management.
